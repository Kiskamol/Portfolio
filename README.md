## About me
I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a Data Analyst And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I got my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration(Technology Management) from the King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang and have been working as a Data Analyst for 6 months, found myself didn't like it so much and feel that software testing job is very interesting.

Now, I'm learning The Complete 2023 Software Testing Bootcamp course, Its give me a lot of software tesing knowledge. And Since i love to code i want to be an Autometed QA but i have to learn more of the framework and doing more projects
